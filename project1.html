<p>The touch screen user interface for a shower is a futuristic concept that takes technology right into our bath tubs.</p></br>
<p><h3 id="basics" style="background-color:#4682b4; width:20%;">The basic concept of the UI</h3></p>
<p style="border: solid 2px grey; width:65%; text-align:justify; padding:5px;">
The basic idea behind this UI design is to provide user with an interactive display that is easy to use and gives more power of control to the user. The interface should also allow more hardware control and additional features which are not available in current generation of shower systems.

<div>
<h2 id="new" style="background-color:#4682b4; border-radius:8px 8px 8px 8px; text-align:center;">Why this design works?</h2>
<p>The main reason this design is good that it is simplistic. It allows a user to get more power using minimal details and depth. It provides powerful controls and high end features without compromising simplicity.</br>
The touch panel is a colorful interface, and it's known that a colorful design is more attractive and easy to use. The icons used in the design are big enough to be easily seen by a person who wears spectacles. The icon images are very intuitive and don't need any additional text to convey their use. The user can just touch and dispense soap, facewash and shampoo liquids. This completely eliminates the overhead of carrying soap or shampoo bottles to the shower. </br>
Music is a very good to have in the shower. Most of the people turn to themselves and become bathroom singers. But for those with no sense of singing (like me!), having a music system is a great feature. The user has the luxury to choose the genre of music as per his mood and the system will play the pre loaded songs of that type. The user can also control volume of the speakers. </p></br>
<p style="border: solid 2px grey; width:65%; text-align:justify; padding:5px;">
The panel is placed on the front wall of the bath tub. The reason to choose this location is accessibility. The user will usually be in two states in the bath tub - either standing and taking a shower or laying down in the bath tub. The panel is placed at such a location that it is easily accessible from both positions.
